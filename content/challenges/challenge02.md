#### Goals

- Get more practice with our p5.js toolkit
- Get practice working with graphics contexts 
- Continue to develop your spatial sense
- Exercise a little creativity


## Objective

Your second challenge is to draw something with [_Truchet tiles_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truchet_tiles). Take a moment to read up on them and get inspired by some images. 


## Getting Started


1. Click the GitHub classroom [link](https://classroom.github.com/a/HtfgfsPA)
1. Clone the repository GitHub classroom creates to your local computer (in your shell, type `git clone` and the name of the repository)



## Requirements

- I would like you to design (or reimplement) a minimum of two tile types (we have not talked about how to rotate things, so if you want different orientations of the tiles, you can just make additional tiles, and that will count). Remember that for a Truchet tile, I won't see the same thing if I rotate it ninety degrees. 

- You should use an offscreen graphics context for your tiles. Create separate ones for each tile type. 

- The **width** of the finished piece should be 800 pixels.

- The piece should be entirely tiled. 


## Thoughts

- The simplest Truchet tiles can be whipped up pretty quickly. Doing so isn't a bad place to start before you start thinking about ways to add some creativity to the mix. 

- You are welcome to be intentional about the tile placement, or to add randomness (p5.js has its own [`random](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/random) function). 


## Reflection

I would like you to write a brief reflection in the README file. It should answer the following questions:

- Do you think it is complete?
- If not, what is left to go and how are you going to address it?
- What was the hardest part?
- What, if anything, have you gained by completing this challenge?


### Revisions

If you revise your submission, please add a _dated_ addition to your reflection that describes what has been changed. 



## Submitting 

When you are ready to submit, 
- commit your changes to your git repository (`git add` and `git commit` -- see the [guide](../resources/git) for details)
- push your changes to GitHub (`git push`). _For 312 alums, don't worry about PRs -- a straight commit is fine_

_Important: it is tempting to treat all of our deadlines as "loose" -- this is a dangerous path! Get **something** done by the deadline and submit. You can always go back to it, and you will get the benefit of my feedback. Just make sure that your reflection acknowledges that it isn't complete._
