## Objective

For your first project, I would like you to visualize time.

Requirements:

- You can work in any granularity of time that you like, but it is important that your piece shows the time _now_. You can include a sense of history or other aspects, but some element must be something that could be interpreted as _now_.
- You may not use any text or anything that could be interpreted as text. Quantities, however, are fine.
- Your piece doesn't need to be readable to someone who randomly encounters it, but it must be interpretable to someone who knows how to read it. It is okay if this is a proportional thing -- it is more important to know that we are half way or completely through a minute than it is to know that we are at second 24.

## Getting Started

1. Click the GitHub classroom [link](https://classroom.github.com/a/L4a_CO1A)
1. Clone the repository GitHub classroom creates to your local computer (in your shell, type `git clone` and the name of the repository)

## Details

I have included some code in the skeleton that prints out a collection of date and time values to the console. You are not restricted to this set, nor are you required to use them all.

Note that not all of these values are straightforward to interpret (e.g., January is month 0). I encourage you to [read the documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date).

_I encourage you to remove the `console.log` once you understand it. Writing out to the console is very slow and is not recommended in animation loops once you are done debugging._

## Documentation and Reflection

In the README file, I would like you to write a description of your piece and how to read it. I should be able to use your description to understand all of the ways you have mapped the current time to a visual representation.

In the `reflection.md` file, I would like you to write a reflection.

- What (if anything) still is not complete?
- If it is not complete, what is left and how are you going to address it?
- What (if anything) did you struggle with?
- What, if anything, have you gained by completing this project?

### Revisions

If you revise your submission, please add a _dated_ addition to your reflection that describes what has been changed.

## Submitting

- commit your changes to your git repository (`git add` and `git commit` -- see the [guide](../resources/git) for details)
- push your changes to GitHub (`git push`). _For 312 alums, don't worry about PRs -- a straight commit is fine_
- submit the repository on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/873354/assignments/5029470) ([submission directions](../resources/gradescope))

_Important: it is tempting to treat all of our deadlines as "loose" -- this is a dangerous path! Get **something** done by the deadline and submit. You can always go back to it, and you will get the benefit of my feedback. Just make sure that your reflection acknowledges that it isn't complete._
