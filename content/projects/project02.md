## Objective

For your second project, I would like you to make an audio reactive piece that shows off some of the techniques that you have learned.

\__Note: The critique session for the first project was very successful and a number of you said that they wished they had pieces that were ready for peer critique. So for this project, we have an earlier draft deadline to prepare for the session and I will expect everyone to participate._

## Getting Started

1. Click the GitHub classroom [link](https://classroom.github.com/a/72rdmxjV)
1. Clone the repository GitHub classroom creates to your local computer (in your shell, type `git clone` and the name of the repository)

## Details

The content of the piece is up to you, but it must be centered on some sound. The sound can be anything you like. It could be a piece of music, it could be you reading beat poetry, it could be a field recording, or it could just be the sound of you dropping ping-pong balls down the stairs (as an aside -- modern cell phones make fine recording devices). It should also be obvious that the visual is _reacting_ to the sound (as opposed to just scripting animations to match the timeline of the sound).

In addition, I would like you to incorporate _at least_ **two** of the following techniques that you have learned recently:

- noise
- particles
- feedback

## Documentation and Reflection

In the README file, I would like you to write a description of your piece that includes a discussion of which techniques you used and how they support your vision.

In the `reflection.md` file, I would like you to write a reflection.

- What (if anything) still is not complete?
- If it is not complete, what is left and how are you going to address it?
- What (if anything) did you struggle with?
- What, if anything, have you gained by completing this project?

### Revisions

If you revise your submission, please add a _dated_ addition to your reflection that describes what has been changed.

## Submitting

- commit your changes to your git repository (`git add` and `git commit` -- see the [guide](../resources/git) for details)
- push your changes to GitHub (`git push`). _For 312 alums, don't worry about PRs -- a straight commit is fine_
- submit the repository on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/873354/assignments/5191549) ([submission directions](../resources/gradescope))

_Important: it is tempting to treat all of our deadlines as "loose" -- this is a dangerous path! Get **something** done by the deadline and submit. You can always go back to it, and you will get the benefit of my feedback. Just make sure that your reflection acknowledges that it isn't complete._
