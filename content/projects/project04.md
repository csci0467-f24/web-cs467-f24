## Objective

For your final project, I would like you to show me what you have learned. You can produce almost anything you like, but it should be a showstopper -- something that demonstrates everything you have learned. I have just a few requirements for you.

#### Requirements

- The piece should in some way make use of **at least three** identifiable techniques discussed in the class
- **At least one** technique should be from this list: physics simulation, particle systems, audio-reactivity, cellular automata, autonomous agents, or genetic programming
- The piece should be sufficiently complex that you feel comfortable that it represents the culmination of what you have learned in this class.
- There should be a clear vision, with an implementation that follows through on it
- Everything should work

### Going beyond

You are welcome, and encouraged, to stretch beyond what we have done in class. Maybe you want to add some ML? use the camera? incorporate other libraries? That would be great!

## Getting Started

1. Click the GitHub classroom [link](https://classroom.github.com/a/bpCU668e)
1. Clone the repository GitHub classroom creates to your local computer (in your shell, type `git clone` and the name of the repository)

## Deadlines

There will be several deadlines for the project.

- 2024-11-18 2:15p - Submit a proposal on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/873354/assignments/5318577)
- 2024-12-02 2:15p - Share during critique session
- 2024-12-09 5:00p - Everything should be fully submitted
- 2024-12-10 3:00p - Show time

The proposal should be typed into the Gradescope text entry field. It should

- clearly describe what you want to do
- list the techniques that you will make use of
- list anything you will need to learn in order to complete it
- list any challenges you forsee in completing it

For the draft, just add a commit to git with a commit message labeling it as the first draft (more advanced git users can use a tag). The README should have a dated section that describes the current state of the draft, including

- what are you current happy with
- what are you not currently happy with
- what questions do you have about it
- what are the biggest challenges going forward

## Ideas

I know it can be difficult to be told "Go make art". Some of you may have some ideas of what you want to do, but if you don't, here are some prompts to potentially get you moving.

- Create some digital nature. A Generative landscape, virtual creatures, or both.
- Represent memory
- Create an instrument that can be used to perform images (and maybe sound)
- Rethink the alphabet. Draw your own glyphs maybe even animate them.
- Rethink text. Use text as an input to a generative process.
- Rethink data. Use data as input to a generative process. Perhaps make a data self-portrait using data about you
- Rethink communication.
- Use the camera to react to the viewer

## README

The READE.md file must contain a description of your piece, including:

- What do we need to know about interacting with your piece?
- What was your inspiration or concept?
- What techniques did you use and why did you chose them?
- Any references to tutorials, examples, libraries, inspirations etc that played a role in your piece

## Reflection (Different from previous assignments -- please read)

Start with a description of the piece and what you were trying to accomplish. Describe the skills and techniques you brought to bear on the piece.

In a second section I would like you to answer the following questions:

- Do you think it is complete?
- If not, what would you still like to add or change?
- What part are you most proud of?
- What part are you least proud of?
- What was the hardest part?
- What, if anything, have you gained by completing this project?

### Revisions

If you revise your submission, please add a _dated_ addition to your reflection that describes what has been changed.

## Submitting

When you are ready to submit,

- commit your changes to your git repository (`git add` and `git commit` -- see the [guide](../resources/git) for details)
- push your changes to GitHub (`git push`). _For 312 alums, don't worry about PRs -- a straight commit is fine_
- submit the repository on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/873354/assignments/5320308) ([submission directions](../resources/gradescope))

_Important: it is tempting to treat all of our deadlines as "loose" -- this is a dangerous path! Get **something** done by the deadline and submit. You can always go back to it, and you will get the benefit of my feedback. Just make sure that your reflection acknowledges that it isn't complete._
