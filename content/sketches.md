One of the requirements for this class is that you maintain a virtual "sketchbook". What does that mean?

## Sketching

In physical terms, we think of a sketch as being a rough, possibly hastily made, drawing or painting. A virtual sketch will be similar, but made with code. These are typically quick experiments to test out ideas. While you shouldn't completely abandon good programming practices, they definitely take a back seat to quick exploration. This is a place where happy accidents can happen. Maybe in your haste, you don't achieve what you set out to, but it still is visually compelling -- that's okay. Or maybe you implement what you meant to, but visually it falls flat -- that's also okay.  

Please read the articles written by Zach Leiberman about his daily sketches in [2016](https://medium.com/@zachlieberman/daily-sketches-2016-28586d8f008e) and [2017](https://medium.com/@zachlieberman/daily-sketches-in-2017-1b4234b0615d). Leiberman discusses a lot about his approach, and how he views the sketching process, which I think will be valuable to you. He also goes into a fair amount of detail about his various experiments which will hopefully serve as inspiration for you.

I will not be asking you to do daily sketches (though I won't stand in your way either). However, I will expect to see a couple of sketches a week. 

## What to sketch?

Your sketchbook is for pretty much anything that isn't a formal deliverable.

- sketches you produce as "class notes" 
- experiments with new techniques or ideas
- variations on a theme
- rough versions of projects and other deliverables
- unexplored branches that come from the formal deliverables
- things you find online or in books that you want to try out
- full pieces that you are working on


## Critiquing

Once the semester gets going, we will have frequent critique sessions. I'll ask for volunteers to show us a sketch (or family of sketches) and we will talk about them. This will be an opportunity to share what you are interested in, but also to get feedback from the class about new directions to try or how to deal with issues that are vexing you.

## Getting started


To get started, please visit our [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/a/7v_3d_nP) and accept the assignment, which will set you up with a skeleton sketchbook. The README has more information about how to work with the skeleton and deploy it, so please make sure to read it. 

_If you are not familiar with Git, please take a moment to read through the [Git intro](./resources/git)._
